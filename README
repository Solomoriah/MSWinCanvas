MSWinCanvas.py defines a class and utility functions for use by programs 
needing to print complex output on Windows 2K/XP hosts.

Canvas is a class for creating and running print jobs.  At present, it
provides the subset of methods used by PollyReports, and some functions
are incomplete or "stubbed."

listprinters() returns a list of printer names.  The default printer is the 
first element of the list, and all other printers follow in alphabetical order.

desc(printer) returns a dictionary containing the descriptive fields
for the named printer.  

getfont(name, size) returns a win32ui font object for the named
font scaled to the given size.  Font substitution may have been
done by Windows, so don't be surprised if you don't get what you
asked for.
