MSWinCanvas.py defines a class and utility functions for use by programs 
needing to print complex output on Windows 2K/XP hosts.

Canvas is a class for creating and running print jobs.  At present, it
provides the subset of methods used by PollyReports, and some functions
are incomplete or "stubbed."

listprinters() returns a list of printer names.  The default printer is the 
first element of the list, and all other printers follow in alphabetical order.

desc(printer) returns a dictionary containing the descriptive fields
for the named printer.
